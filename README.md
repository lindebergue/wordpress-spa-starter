# wordpress-spa-starter

wordpress-spa-starter is a template that I use for creating WordPress themes.
It currently uses:

- TypeScript
- SASS
- React.js
- React Router
- GSAP for animations
- Code spliting with Suspense support
- Integration with rest-hooks for reading data from WordPress REST API
- Three.js using react-three-fiber
- Advanced Custom Fields for metaboxes and theme options pages
- Development and deploy cycle using Docker
